<p>Specify a credentials id to be a part of the pipeline environment in a slightly opinionated way.</p>
<p><strong>This is intended to be used in declarative pipelines, see example below.</strong></p>
<p>
    In the below example, if the credentials with id <em>my-login-id</em> is a Standard Username and Password
    the environment would be populated with three variables: LOGIN, LOGIN_USR and LOGIN_PSW.
    If the credentials is for example a secret text, the variable LOGIN would contain that secret text. Etc.
</p>
<pre>
    pipeline {
        agent any
        environment {
            LOGIN = credentials 'my-login-id'
        }
    }
</pre>

<p>

        <em><strong>Advanced:</strong></em><br/>
        The step can be used in standard pipeline scripts where it returns an object that can generate the parameters
        to send to the <code>withCredentials</code> step.
        To do that either call <code>List params = c.resolveParameters("MY_VAR")</code> or <code>c.addParameters("MY_VAR", myExistingList)</code>
</p>
